        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This BBQ chicken pizza has spicy barbecue sauce, diced chicken, peppers, onion, and cilantro,
            all covered with cheese and baked to bubbly goodness! This is similar to a recipe
            I had at a popular pizza place in California. My family loves it!
